# Budget Calculator
# - Sean Lenhart

## Notes
- I started by creating a new React app and writing a blank README before committing to git.

- I stripped App.js and added a components folder with a new component, Outline, which I will use to sketch the overall project in order to help decide what components I will need. I placed Outline in App.
